Module 2 - Resource Scheduling Configuration
====================
## Practice Lab 2 - Skills and characteristics 

## Scenario

Worldwide Industries (WWI) provides IT and networking services to their
customers. Their services range from phone system and network installations to
telephoning systems and security system installations. They are going to be
leveraging Dynamics 365 for Field Service for installation and servicing of
these systems for their customers. You are the system implementor that has been
tasked with configuring the application to support the rollout of the
application. You will be adding and configuring some products that can be
installed and setting up skills and characteristics that will be used as part of
the implementation.

Exercise 1 - Configure Dynamics 365 for Field Service Skills and Characteristics
================================================================================

Each technician that goes out to service customers may have a number of
different skills and roles assigned to them. There are three primary roles
that tech may have:

-   Installation Specialist

-   Site Inspector

-   Security Analyst

Additionally, each technician may have specific skills or Certifications
that relate to a specific product or service. The most common certifications
might be any of the following:

-   **CISM:** Certified Information Security Manager.

-   **CISSP:** Certified Information Systems Security Professional.

-   **G SEC:** GIAN Security Essentials

Since some of your customers are government agencies, technicians may need
to have specific security clearance levels. These can range from Level one
to Level five.

different security clearance levels that can be applied.

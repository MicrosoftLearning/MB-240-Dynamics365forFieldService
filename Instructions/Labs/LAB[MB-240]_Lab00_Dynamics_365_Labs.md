# Practice Lab - Validate lab environment

## Scenario

Worldwide Industries (WWI) provides IT and networking services to their customers. Their services range from phone system and network installations to telephoning systems and security system installations. They are going to be leveraging Dynamics 365 for Field Service for installation and servicing of these systems for their customers. You are the system implementor that has been tasked with configuring the application to support the rollout of the application. You will be adding and configuring some products that can be installed and setting up skills and characteristics that will be used as part of the implementation.

In this Module 0 lab, you will validate that your classroom tenant is working as expected. You will access your individual credentials, record your “*alias*”, and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course.

**Important notice for instructors:** Please do not make any changes, including adding licenses or changing tenant password. Tenants are fully provisioned with all necessary licenses, environments, and applications to complete the required tenants. Instructors and students should not add any additional functionality outside of the published lab steps. Adding additional functionality will cause the tenant to break and become inactive, and changing tenant password will inhibit the recycling of the tenant for the next class. Thank you for your cooperation.

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.

## Exercise 1 - Access the Dynamics 365 application

### Task 1 – Log into the Power Platform admin center

1. Access <https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com> and log in with your Dynamics 365 tenant credentials.

1. Record your user credential up to the **@** symbol on a scratch piece of paper or in Notepad. This wil be your lab alias that you will use to differentiate the data you create within the shared Dynamics 365 organization.

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your user's prefix (ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, flows, etc. that you create.

1. Feel free to explore the Power Platform admin center but **do not make any changes.**

### Task 2 – Access the Dynamics 365 application

1. Access <https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments>.

1. Select the **WWLLABnnn** environment, where nnn is a number. This is the shared Dynamics 365 environment where you will be performing all labs.

1. Click **Open environment**.

1. From the list of available Dynamics 365 apps, select the **Field Service** app.

1. Spend a few minutes exploring the application.

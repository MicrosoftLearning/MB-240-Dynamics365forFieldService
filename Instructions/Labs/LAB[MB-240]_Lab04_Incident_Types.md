# Practice Lab 4 - Incident types
## Scenario
Many of Contoso Coffees’ work orders are similar in the fact that the products, services, and tasks are all the same. One that they perform often is preventative maintenance on commercial coffee equipment. To improve the amount of time that it takes to enter items into the system, Contoso wants to have templates that can be selected when new work orders are created that will pre-populate information onto a work order. 

In this lab, you will be creating an Incident Type that will be used for preventative maintenance as a template for creating work orders.
